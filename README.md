This project will be focused on transmitting data from a computer to a microcontroller specifically it will transmit image data in the form of bytes ideally it will be able to transmit both RGB and black and white image data. There are several ways to do this. My focus will be wireless instead of wired communication. The options are wifi, bluetooth, and radio and in each of the domains the main algorithms would be the protocols for communication and the main design aspect is going to be sequence diagrams and I may be able to establish my own protocol to achieve this effect of data sharing. Because the focus is protocols this should be able to work with any microcontroller that can support these protocols
